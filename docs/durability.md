# Trine KV V1 Durability Notes

This document describes the v1 durability contract as implemented today. It is
intentionally plain: storage behavior should be predictable under normal use,
and conservative when files are incomplete or suspicious.

## Scope

Persistent databases store WAL, SSTable, manifest, blob, lock, and repair-report
files under one database directory. In-memory databases do not promise
filesystem durability.

Durability in v1 means:

- committed persistent writes are appended to the WAL before they become visible
  in memtables;
- startup replays valid WAL records newer than the manifest replay floor;
- table, manifest, WAL, and blob corruption is detected with checksums or
  format checks;
- uncertain formal storage files fail closed instead of being guessed into a
  live database state.

Durability in v1 does not mean:

- replication across machines;
- atomic multi-directory updates;
- online backup semantics;
- protection from broken disks, broken filesystems, or disabled platform syncs;
- encryption or authentication of on-disk files.

## Write Durability Modes

`WriteOptions::durability` controls how the WAL writer handles each committed
batch:

| mode | implementation | honest guarantee |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Buffered` | write the framed WAL record and return after `write_all` succeeds | Fastest mode. The write is in the OS path, but no explicit flush or sync is requested. A crash or power loss can lose it. |
| `Flush` | call `File::flush` after the WAL append | Pushes Rust and OS-facing buffered bytes as far as `flush` provides. It is not a power-loss guarantee. |
| `SyncData` | call `File::sync_data` after the WAL append | Requests durable WAL file data without requiring all metadata to be synced. |
| `SyncAll` | call `File::sync_all` after the WAL append | Strongest commit mode for the WAL file. It asks the platform to sync file data and metadata. |

`DbOptions::durability` is the database-level durability floor. Per-write
`WriteOptions` can ask for a stronger mode, but cannot quietly weaken the mode
selected at open time. With default options this floor is `Buffered`.

`Db::persist(mode)` applies the same persistence request to the WAL. It does not
force a memtable flush, run compaction, or rewrite already published tables.

## Commit Ordering

The writer coordinator serializes commit sequence assignment and memtable
updates. A non-empty commit follows this order:

1. validate batch-wide preconditions and optimistic transaction read sets;
2. assign the next commit sequence;
3. append a complete WAL record with checksums;
4. apply the batch to memtables;
5. publish the new last committed sequence.

Reads do not take the writer coordinator. Snapshots use sequence visibility, so
readers can keep a stable view while later writes, flushes, or compactions
continue.

## WAL Recovery

The WAL is append-only. Each record stores a magic value, format version, record
length, header checksum, payload checksum, commit sequence, and batch
operations.

Startup behavior:

- valid records replay in commit-sequence order;
- records at or below the manifest replay floor are skipped;
- a torn final record can be ignored as a tail truncation;
- checksum mismatch before the final tail fails closed;
- a WAL record is not visible unless it replays successfully after manifest
  load.

If a WAL record references a keyspace that is missing from the manifest, startup
fails closed. This prevents a partially published keyspace change from silently
turning into a different database state.

## Flush And Manifest Publish

Flush writes immutable memtable contents into SSTables and then publishes a
manifest edit. SSTable files are written with checked blocks and `sync_all`
before the manifest points at them. Manifest publishing writes a temporary file,
syncs it, and renames it into place.

The manifest stores:

- keyspace definitions and options;
- live SSTable ids and compaction levels;
- live blob file ids;
- the WAL replay floor.

New SSTables become part of the live database only after the manifest edit is
published. If a crash leaves a formal table or blob file that is not referenced
by the manifest, v1 fails closed at startup. Safe temporary files are handled by
the repair policy described below.

On Unix and Windows, table and blob output paths sync the temporary file, rename
it into place, and sync the database directory before the manifest points at
those files. Manifest and repair-report publish paths sync their temporary file,
rename it into place, and then sync the parent directory. Rust's standard
library does not expose a portable directory sync for every target, so other
targets keep a best-effort rename path and the same conservative recovery
checks.

## SSTable And Blob Checks

SSTables are immutable files made of checked blocks:

- data blocks;
- range tombstone blocks;
- filter blocks;
- index blocks;
- properties block;
- footer.

Each block records codec id, decoded length, encoded length, and checksum. The
footer records magic, format version, section handles, and footer checksum.
Startup fails closed when a manifest-referenced table is missing, has corrupt
checksums, has an unsupported format, or disagrees with manifest metadata.

Large separated values live in blob files. Blob references are visible only
through committed WAL records or published SSTables. Blob files include
checksums, and cleanup cannot remove a blob that is still referenced by a live
table or an active snapshot.

## Compaction And Cleanup

Compaction writes new SSTables first and publishes them through a manifest edit.
Input tables and obsolete blob files are removed only after the new manifest
state is installed and active snapshot floors allow cleanup.

Compaction must preserve:

- the newest visible point value for each key;
- versions pinned by active snapshots;
- point tombstones needed to hide older records;
- range tombstones needed to hide covered records;
- blob references still reachable from live tables or snapshots.

Automatic compaction may run after flush when L0 file pressure exceeds
`DbOptions::max_l0_files`. The same recovery and manifest-publish rules apply to
manual and automatic compaction.

## Recovery And Repair Policy

Persistent startup is conservative:

1. acquire the database directory lock unless opened read-only;
2. load the manifest;
3. validate referenced tables and blobs;
4. reject unexpected formal table/blob files;
5. replay WAL records newer than the replay floor;
6. rebuild memtables from replayed records.

Default corruption policy is `FailClosed`. In that mode, startup returns an
error for corruption, unsupported files, missing referenced files, unreferenced
formal storage files, and safe temporary files.

`FailOnCorruptionPolicy::RepairSafeTemporaryFiles` is intentionally narrow. It
can delete known safe temporary files and writes a repair report. It does not
repair WAL corruption, manifest corruption, table corruption, missing referenced
files, unreferenced formal storage files, or blob corruption.

## Locking And Read-Only Open

Writer opens take an exclusive process lock in the database directory. A second
writer fails while the lock is held. The lock is released after the writer
coordinator is idle during close/drop, so another process cannot open while the
current process is still publishing files.

Read-only opens do not take the writer lock and do not create a WAL writer. They
still load the manifest, validate referenced files, and replay WAL records into
memory. Use read-only opens for inspection of a stable directory state; v1 does
not define live multi-process read coordination with a concurrent writer.

## Operational Guidance

- Use `SyncAll` for writes that must survive ordinary power loss as far as the
  platform can provide.
- Call `Db::persist(SyncAll)` after a group of lower-durability writes when a
  batch-level sync point is acceptable.
- Call `Db::flush()` when reducing WAL replay time matters.
- Keep the whole database directory on one local filesystem.
- Treat any fail-closed startup error as a signal to preserve the directory for
  inspection before deleting files.
- Use explicit safe-temporary-file repair only when the caller accepts the
  repair report and understands that formal storage files are not repaired.
