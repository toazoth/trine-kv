# Current Phase

## Status

In progress

## Goal

Build the v1 engine in measured slices without silently changing the accepted
protocol.

## Entry Condition

- Phase 2 crate scaffold is complete.
- `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy`, and scaffold tests passed.
- The v1 protocol remains the implementation source of truth.

## Scope

- Implement one behavior slice at a time.
- Keep each slice aligned with MVCC, write batch, snapshot, WAL, SSTable,
  manifest, compaction, transaction, prefix-filter, compression, and
  search-policy contracts.
- Add tests before claiming a slice works.

## Out Of Scope

- Implementing multiple adjacent engine subsystems in one unverified jump.
- Changing public protocol behavior without updating the spec or an ADR.
- Adding external codec crates before codec behavior and fixtures are ready.
- Persistent crash recovery before in-memory MVCC point semantics exist.

## Acceptance Gate

- The v1 acceptance gate in `.phrase/protocol/trine-kv-v1-spec.md` passes.
- Each slice records its verification evidence and remaining blockers.

## Active Task Slice

```

## Known Blockers

- Recovery reports, version-cleaning compaction, blob files, prefix filters, and
  optimized search policies are not implemented yet.

## Evidence To Record

- Phase 2 scaffold gate results.
- Prefix-filter validation results.
- Remaining blocker category after first prefix-filter slice.
