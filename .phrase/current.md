# Current Phase

## Status

In progress

## Goal

Audit and harden production-facing operational behavior after API polish.

## Entry Condition

- Phase 5 API polish is complete.
- V1 tests, quickstart, docs, and benchmark baseline are present.

## Scope

- Operational failure modes around recovery, file cleanup, locks, WAL replay,
  flush/compaction publish, resource limits, and diagnostics.
- Focused code changes only after an audit exposes a concrete risk.
- Tests that reproduce the risk or prove the hardened path.

## Out Of Scope

- Changing v1 storage contracts without an ADR or protocol update.
- Packaging and release automation.
- Performance tuning that is not tied to a hardening risk.

## Acceptance Gate

- At least one production-hardening audit result is recorded.
- Any code change has a focused regression test.
- `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`, and `git diff --check`
  pass.

```

## Known Blockers

- Manifest publish failure no longer advances in-memory manifest state.
- WAL decode now rejects impossible operation counts before allocation.
- Startup cleanup fail-closed behavior is covered by existing tests.
- Manifest and table decoders now reject impossible count fields before large
  allocation.
- Flush/compaction cleanup and diagnostics need the next hardening audit.

## Evidence To Record

- Audit result with risk category.
- Fix and regression test if the risk is local.
- WAL resource-bound audit result.
- Follow-up startup cleanup and manifest/table decode resource-bound audit
  result.
- Flush/compaction cleanup and diagnostics audit result.
